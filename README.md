## Sum Of Two Numbers
The function "add" has two parameters "param1" and "param2."
The addition of "param1" and "param2" are stored int the constant variable result.
The addition of the two paramaters is returned by returning "result"



## First Duplicate Number
The given function is "int firstDuplicate(int[] a)."
The for loop initializes "i" and increments until "i" is equal to a.length to parse through the array.
An if statement is made to check if there is a duplicate number and if so, the duplicate number of the smaller index is returned.
If there are no such duplicates, -1 is returned.
